Scientific Meetings. Trainee Members can only elect the postdoctoral and student representatives.

## Governance

### Committee

The Chapter shall be governed by a Committee of not less than six and not more than twelve Full
Members, two Postdoctoral Representatives (fulfilling definition of ISMRM Trainee but not a Student
Member) and one non-voting Student Representative (who must be a Student Member). All requirements
for Chapter governance per the ISMRM bylaws will be met.

Decisions shall be taken by a majority vote of those present, the Chair having an additional casting vote in
case of a tie. Additional “Observers” may be co-opted to serve by a majority vote of the Committee. 

Full committee members shall serve for three years plus one year of transition, or longer if elected to an officer
position. The Postdoctoral Representatives shall serve for two years only. The Student Representative
shall serve for one year only. The Committee shall meet at least once each year and shall hold an Annual
General Meeting of the Chapter at which it will report the year's activities to the members.

### Duties and Powers of the Executive Commmittee

All officials will be elected by the committee, except for the Chair who will be elected by a vote of the full
membership. Members who are elected as officials shall serve in that role for three years and will remain

coordinating.

Any officer can resign or can be removed from their position if deemed to be unable to perform his or her
duties by a majority of Committee members.

Nominations can be made by the Committee itself, aiming to keep a balanced representation of both
Portuguese and Spanish ISMRM communities, or by individual Members (and may include
self-nomination). Calls for nominations will be made by the Secretary at the Annual General Meeting and
by email to all Members. In the case of there being more than one candidate for a given vacancy then a
ballot of the committee will be organised by the Secretary.

Postdoctoral Representative will be elected by a secret ballot of students and trainees at the Annual
Scientific Meeting each year, a call for nominations being made by the Secretary prior to the meeting.

The Student Representative shall be elected by a secret ballot of student and trainee members at the
Annual Scientific Meeting, a call for nominations being made by the Secretary at an appropriate time prior
to the meeting.

the bi-annual newsletter and organising social/networking activities for the Annual ISMRM Iberian
Scientific meeting.

## Subscription and Finances

The annual subscription shall be decided by a majority vote of the Committee. The Treasurer shall
maintain one or more bank accounts in the Chapter's name. Cheques drawn on the accounts shall be
signed by any of the following officers: The Treasurer, the Chair, the Vice-Chair or the Secretary.
